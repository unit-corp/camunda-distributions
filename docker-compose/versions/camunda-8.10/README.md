# Camunda 8 Self-Managed - Docker Compose

## Usage

For end user usage, please check the official documentation of [Camunda 8 Self-Managed Docker Compose](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/next/self-managed/quickstart/developer-quickstart/docker-compose/).

## Centralized secrets

1. Open the included `secrets/` directory and create a file named `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your editor. Save only the secret value, not `KEY=value`, as UTF-8 without a byte-order mark.
2. Start the lightweight stack with `docker compose up -d`, or the full stack with `docker compose -f docker-compose-full.yaml up -d`.
3. Reference the secret in a service-task or connector input mapping:

  ```feel
  =camunda.secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY
  ```

No Compose or application YAML changes are needed. Both stacks mount `secrets/` read-only into Orchestration at `/etc/camunda/secrets` and configure `camunda.secrets.stores.file.default.path` through `CAMUNDA_SECRETS_STORES_FILE_DEFAULT_PATH`. The directory is not mounted into Connectors.

Each filename is a secret name; its contents are the value. Use letters, numbers, underscores, or dashes in names. Names containing dashes need FEEL backticks, for example ``=camunda.secrets.`openai-api-key` ``. One trailing newline is ignored; other whitespace is part of the value.

You can add files while the stack is running. Changed or deleted values can remain cached for up to 20 minutes by default. For immediate local retesting, restart Orchestration with `docker compose restart orchestration` (add `-f docker-compose-full.yaml` for the full stack). Creating a missing secret does not automatically resolve an existing incident; resolve that incident in Operate after creating the file.

The existing `connector-secrets.txt` file still supplies only the Connectors environment for legacy `{{secrets.NAME}}` references. It is not imported into the centralized store, and the two workflows are independent.

These files are plaintext local-development credentials, not production secret storage. The included Git ignore rules keep their contents out of ordinary commits; do not force-add them, include them in shared archives, or put values in BPMN. For production, configure a supported managed store such as AWS Secrets Manager or Google Secret Manager. On native Linux, the directory and files must be readable by the container user (UID 1001); host-user-only permissions may prevent access.

## Application configuration

Camunda services read their application settings from YAML mounted by Docker Compose:

- The lightweight `docker-compose.yaml` keeps its Connectors YAML inline under `configs`, preserving the compact setup. Orchestration mounts the selected file from `configuration/`.
- The OAuth2 setups import the shared Keycloak realm from `.keycloak/orchestration-connectors-realm.json`. Each setup mounts its matching `.orchestration/application-oauth2*.yaml` file. Both files preserve `.orchestration/application.yaml` as their baseline so their intentional OAuth2, storage, endpoint, and TLS differences remain reviewable.
- The full and standalone setups share component files under `.identity/` and `.hub/`. The standalone-only Identity overlay remains inline in `docker-compose-hub.yaml`.
- The full setup additionally uses `.orchestration/application.yaml`, `.connectors/application.yaml`, and the files under `.optimize/`. Hub cluster registrations are isolated in `.hub/application-full.yaml`.

The mounted files reference runtime values from `.env` with `${VARIABLE:default}` placeholders. Keep environment-specific endpoints and secrets in `.env`; direct Spring environment variables can still override file values. Hub database and Pusher credentials remain direct environment variables, matching the Helm deployment. PostgreSQL, Keycloak, Hub WebSockets, and other non-Spring services continue to use their native environment-based configuration.

## Elasticsearch

- `docker-compose.yaml` uses the default H2 secondary storage and does not start Elasticsearch.
- `docker-compose-full.yaml` starts Elasticsearch as the `elasticsearch` service, which Optimize and the Orchestration Cluster exporter use.
- To use an externally managed instance instead, point `ELASTICSEARCH_URL`, `ELASTICSEARCH_HOST`, `ELASTICSEARCH_PORT`, and `ELASTICSEARCH_CLUSTER_NAME` in `.env` at that endpoint and remove the `elasticsearch` service.

Example:

```bash
cd docker-compose/versions/camunda-8.10
docker compose -f docker-compose-full.yaml up -d
```

## Switching secondary storage databases

The Orchestration container now mounts `configuration/<file>.yaml` into `/usr/local/camunda/config/application.yaml`.  
Set `ORCHESTRATION_CONFIG_FILE` in `.env` (or export it before running `docker compose`) to one of the provided samples:

- `application-h2.yaml` (default, file-based H2)
- `application-mysql.yaml`
- `application-mariadb.yaml`
- `application-postgresql.yaml`
- `application-mssql.yaml`
- `application-oracle.yaml`
- `application-opensearch.yaml`

Feel free to copy these files and adjust the JDBC URL/credentials for your environment. Example:

```bash
cd docker-compose/versions/camunda-8.10
export ORCHESTRATION_CONFIG_FILE=application-mysql.yaml
docker compose up -d
```

The `application-opensearch.yaml` sample expects an OpenSearch instance reachable at `http://opensearch:9200`. OpenSearch is not bundled, so either point the URL at an existing instance or add one via a `docker-compose.override.yaml` on the same network — see [configure secondary storage with Docker Compose](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/next/self-managed/quickstart/developer-quickstart/docker-compose/secondary-storage/) for a ready-made example.

### JDBC drivers

The Camunda Docker image automatically loads any `.jar` dropped into `/driver-lib`. A writable `driver-lib/` folder is included next to the compose file so you can copy the vendor JDBC driver there before starting (e.g., `driver-lib/mysql-connector-j-9.0.0.jar`). This is required for MySQL and Oracle. PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, and H2 drivers are already bundled in the image — see [supported JDBC driver versions](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/next/self-managed/concepts/databases/relational-db/rdbms-support-policy/#bundled-drivers) for the authoritative list.

## Generating the gRPC TLS certificate

The `docker-compose-oauth2-tls.yaml` setup enables TLS for the Orchestration gRPC endpoint only. All Camunda versions share one certificate set under `docker-compose/certificates/`; generate it once by following the [gRPC TLS certificate guide](../../certificates/README.md).

Start the OAuth2 stack without transport TLS:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-oauth2.yaml up -d
```

Start the OAuth2 stack with TLS on gRPC port 26500 only. The same Compose file supports the shared local-CA-signed or corporate-CA-signed `../../certificates/tls.crt`:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-oauth2-tls.yaml up -d
```

## Cleaning all local data

Use a clean reset when the local Zeebe state, H2 secondary storage, or Keycloak data must be recreated from scratch. Run the command that matches the Compose file used to start the stack.

Without gRPC TLS:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-oauth2.yaml down --volumes --remove-orphans
docker compose -f docker-compose-oauth2.yaml up -d --wait --wait-timeout 300
```

With gRPC TLS:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-oauth2-tls.yaml down --volumes --remove-orphans
docker compose -f docker-compose-oauth2-tls.yaml up -d --wait --wait-timeout 300
```

The `down --volumes` command permanently removes all process data, H2 secondary-storage data, and Keycloak realm, user, and client data from this local stack. Docker images and the generated files under `docker-compose/certificates/` are not removed.

## Enabling multi-tenancy

### Lightweight configuration

The lightweight `docker-compose.yaml` runs with basic authentication and an unprotected API. To enable multi-tenancy, protect the API and switch on the tenancy checks by creating a `docker-compose.override.yaml` next to the compose file:

```yaml
services:
  orchestration:
    environment:
      - CAMUNDA_SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION_UNPROTECTEDAPI=false
      - CAMUNDA_SECURITY_MULTITENANCY_CHECKSENABLED=true
      - CAMUNDA_SECURITY_MULTITENANCY_APIENABLED=true
  connectors:
    environment:
      - CAMUNDA_CLIENT_AUTH_METHOD=basic
      - CAMUNDA_CLIENT_AUTH_USERNAME=demo
      - CAMUNDA_CLIENT_AUTH_PASSWORD=demo
```

Then start the stack with `docker compose up -d` and manage tenants through the Orchestration Cluster API (or the Orchestration Cluster Admin UI at `http://localhost:8080/admin`):

```bash
# create a tenant
curl -u demo:demo -X POST http://localhost:8080/v2/tenants \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"tenantId": "tenant-a", "name": "Tenant A"}'
# assign the demo user to it
curl -u demo:demo -X PUT http://localhost:8080/v2/tenants/tenant-a/users/demo
```

API clients must authenticate with basic auth once the API is protected (`camunda.client.auth.method=basic` plus username and password in the Camunda client SDKs).

### Full configuration

The full `docker-compose-full.yaml` already protects the API through Keycloak, so only the tenancy checks need to be switched on. Add the following to `.env`:

```bash
CAMUNDA_SECURITY_MULTITENANCY_CHECKSENABLED=true
CAMUNDA_SECURITY_MULTITENANCY_APIENABLED=true
```

Then start the stack with `docker compose -f docker-compose-full.yaml up -d` and manage tenants through the Orchestration Cluster API with an OAuth token (or the Orchestration Cluster Admin UI at `http://localhost:8080/admin`):

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST 'http://localhost:18080/auth/realms/camunda-platform/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' -d 'client_id=orchestration' -d 'client_secret=secret' | jq -r .access_token)
# create a tenant
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v2/tenants -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"tenantId": "tenant-a", "name": "Tenant A"}'
# assign the demo user to it
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/v2/tenants/tenant-a/users/demo -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
